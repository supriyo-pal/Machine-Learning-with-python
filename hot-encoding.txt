What is One Hot Encoding?
A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors.

This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values.

Then, each integer value is represented as a binary vector that is all zero values except the index of the integer, which is marked with a 1.

Worked Example of a One Hot Encoding
Let’s make this concrete with a worked example.

Assume we have a sequence of labels with the values ‘red’ and ‘green’.

We can assign ‘red’ an integer value of 0 and ‘green’ the integer value of 1. As long as we always assign these numbers to these labels, this is called an integer encoding. 
Consistency is important so that we can invert the encoding later and get labels back from integer values, such as in the case of making a prediction.

Next, we can create a binary vector to represent each integer value. The vector will have a length of 2 for the 2 possible integer values.

The ‘red’ label encoded as a 0 will be represented with a binary vector [1, 0] where the zeroth index is marked with a value of 1. 
In turn, the ‘green’ label encoded as a 1 will be represented with a binary vector [0, 1] where the first index is marked with a value of 1.
If we had the sequence:

['red', 'red', 'green']
 [0,0,1]
output will be :

[1, 0]
[1, 0]
[0, 1]
